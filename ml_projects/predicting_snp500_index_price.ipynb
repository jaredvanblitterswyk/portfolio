    "## Predict stock price for S&P 500 using historical performance\n",
    "In this project, you'll work with data from the S&P500 Index.\n",
    "Indexes aggregate the prices of multiple stocks together, and allow you to see how the market as a whole performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The S&P500 Index aggregates the stock prices of 500 large companies. When an index fund goes up or down, you can say that the primary market or sector it represents is doing the same. For example, if the Dow Jones Industrial Average price goes down one day, you can say that American stocks overall went down (ie, most American stocks went down in price).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be using historical data on the price of the S&P500 Index to make predictions about future prices. Predicting whether an index goes up or down helps forecast how the stock market as a whole performs. Since stocks tend to correlate with how well the economy as a whole is performs, it can also help with economic forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to setup a workflow for evaluating different models with varying features to obtain the best prediction of future performance. The full analysis will be carreid through for a linear regression model and then other models will be considered for comparison. In the inner loop, features will be progressively added and the model performance evaluated to determine which model/features provide the best prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two predictions will be made: a one-step ahead prediction, and a multi-step ahead prediction based on a 95%-5% data split."

    "### A few notes on modeling time series data\n",
    "Obtaining reliable time series predictions is possible if the dependence between values in the past is preserved in the future. This means that the stochastic properties underlying the data do not change with shifts in time. This implies that the first two moments are finite, thus the mean and variance are constant, and the covariance only depends on the time shift and not the start time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two popular approaches that will be considered here are: <br><br>\n",
    "1) nearest neighbour one-step-ahead (use previous n points to predict the value at n+1 - similar to a traditional regression scenario) <br>\n",
    "2) multi-step ahead: multiple one-step-ahead regressors are used to predict the value at h steps ahead. This can be iterative, i.e.: the prediction at t+1 is used as the input to predicting t+2, or only previous values are used, or direct, i.e.: the value at t+h is predicted directly from previous values."
