## Portfolio

This repo contains a collection of various data science projects I have worked on in my spare time.
The projects generally fall into one of three categories including:

  i) data visualization in python and d3.js;
  ii) implementation of machine learning algorithms with scikit-learn for prediction and classification; and
  iii) data engineering: data base management and queries with SQL and MongoDB and API development
