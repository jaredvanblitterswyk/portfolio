### Portfolio
<br />
This repo contains a collection of various data science projects from research and personal interests.
Each project is presented in concise, stand-alone juptyer notebooks. Below is a summary of a sample of projects I have completed/are in progress : <br /><br />

  i) *clean_and_analyze_employee_surveys*: <br> 
  This notebook presents an exploratory analysis of exit surveys from employees at different educational institutes in Australia with a focus on data cleaning. <br />
  
  ii) *expected_goals_prediction*: <br> 
  This notebook describes the implementation of a logistic regression classifier for predicting goal probability using all shots recorded during the 2018-2019 NHL regular season. <br>
  
  iii) *game_summary_dashboard*: <br>
  This notebook presents a custom dashboard that I developed on Python to present a map of all shots on target, goals, and missed shots taken by each team in a single game, along with descriptive summary stats. This incorporates spatial classification of shots as high danger scoring chances, which is often an indicator of wins/losses. <br>
  
  iv) *implement_btree_key_value_database*: <br>
  This is based on a project from the Dataquest data engineer course where I developed a btree database as an alternative to a standard Python dictionary for enahnced read-write performance. <br>
  
  v) *nlp_sentiment_analysis_predict_disasters_from_tweets*: <br>
  Outlines a basic exploration of the performance of standard machine learning classifiers and a deep sequential neural network for sentiment analysis of tweets for detecting if the content is related to a natural disaster. <br>
  
  vi) *SVM_kernels*: <br>
  This is a notebook I put together to provide an introductory overview of the theory and implementation of support vector machines and utilizing the kernel trick for non-linear decision boundaries.
